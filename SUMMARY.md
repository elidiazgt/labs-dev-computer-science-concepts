# Summary

* [Introduction](README.md)
* [First Chapter](chapter1.md)

## Data Structures
* [Array](array.md)
* Linked List
* Stack\/Queue
* Trees \(Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.\)
* Heap
* Hash Table \(this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means\)
* Directed\/Undirected\/Weighted Graphs
* Trie \(pronounced "tree"\)
* Linked Hash Map

## Algoritms
* Sorting algorithms.md)
* Tree traversals \(just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order\)
* Traversals - Dijkstra's, A\*, BFS, DFS \(know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space. Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack\/queue\)
* All the prefix-tree searches
